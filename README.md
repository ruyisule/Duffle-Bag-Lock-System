# Fingerprint Sensor Arduino

This is an Arduino example code for interfacing with a fingerprint sensor using the Adafruit_Fingerprint library. The code demonstrates how to read fingerprint data, search for a fingerprint match, and control an output based on the match result.

## Introduction

This code demonstrates the usage of a fingerprint sensor to perform the following actions:
- Capture a fingerprint image
- Convert the fingerprint image to a template
- Search for a fingerprint match
- Control an output (LED in this case) based on the match result

The Adafruit_Fingerprint library is used to communicate with the fingerprint sensor. The code uses the SoftwareSerial library for communication on platforms without hardware serial.

## Prerequisites

- Arduino board (e.g., UNO)
- Fingerprint sensor compatible with the Adafruit_Fingerprint library
- Arduino IDE installed
- Adafruit_Fingerprint library installed (can be installed via Arduino Library Manager)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `fingerprint_sensor_example.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
3. Make sure to select the appropriate Arduino board and port from the Tools menu.
4. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage

1. Connect the fingerprint sensor to the appropriate pins on your Arduino board.
2. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
3. Open the Serial Monitor to view the output.
4. Place your finger on the sensor when prompted, and the code will attempt to match the fingerprint.
5. Depending on the match result, an appropriate message will be displayed in the Serial Monitor. Additionally, an output (LED) is controlled to indicate the match status.
